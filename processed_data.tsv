90745	Methods of Policy Analysis Future of Work	After decades of slow wage growth and rising inequality many American workers now fear an epidemic of joblessness as new technologies increasingly replace human labor Is this likely to occur How will emerging technologies reshape the U S labor market How important is the gig economy and how big might it become What impact will the COVID crisis have on employment and income inequality in the short run and the long run What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive and equitable The curriculum of 90 745 has been rewritten to help Heinz students and other interested CMU students think seriously and rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy The course will place current concerns in the broader context of the major structural shifts in the U S labor market over the past several decades Drawing upon the most recent quantitative analyses the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the U S labor market for decades and that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds The course will also consider the degree to which globalization immigration rising monopoly power declining union strength minimum wage laws and discrimination based on race and gender have contributed to rising inequality in U S incomes The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old and new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive and it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference The course instructor Professor Branstetter is a globally recognized expert on the economics of innovation and technological change He leads the Future of Work research initiative within CMUs Block Center for Technology and Society He served on the staff of President Barack Obamas Council of Economic Advisers	12	Methods of Policy Analysis: Future of Work	-1	Heinz College	26	20	76.90%	13.05	3.95	3.7	3.5	3.3	4.2	4.1	3.8	4.1	3.6
